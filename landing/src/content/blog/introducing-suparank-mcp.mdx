<TLDR>
- Suparank is now available in free early access
- 19 specialized tools for SEO content workflows
- Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, ChatGPT, and any MCP-compatible client
- Full pipeline from research to WordPress publishing
</TLDR>

Today we're launching Suparank — the missing piece between your AI assistant and professional SEO content workflows.

## Why We Built Suparank

AI has transformed how we write. But the content workflow involves much more than writing:

- Keyword research and competitive analysis
- Content planning and topical mapping
- Writing and optimization
- Image generation and formatting
- Publishing and distribution

Each step traditionally requires different tools, tabs, and context switches. We asked: what if your AI assistant could handle the entire workflow?

## What Suparank Does

Suparank connects to your AI assistant through MCP (Model Context Protocol). If you're new to MCP, our guide on [what is Model Context Protocol](/blog/what-is-model-context-protocol) explains how it works. Instead of copy-pasting between tools, you simply describe what you want:

> "Research keywords around 'content automation', create a topical map, write a comprehensive guide, optimize for SEO, generate a hero image, and publish to WordPress as a draft."

Your AI handles each step using Suparank's 19 specialized tools. Want to see the full potential? Learn [how to automate blog writing with AI](/blog/how-to-automate-blog-writing-with-ai-2026) using these tools:

**SEO Research:**
- `keyword_research` — Find opportunities with volume and difficulty data
- `seo_strategy` — Analyze competitors and identify gaps
- `topical_map` — Build pillar-cluster content architectures
- `content_calendar` — Plan publishing schedules

**Content Creation:**
- `content_write` — Generate SEO-optimized articles

## How It Works

### 1. Install and configure

```bash
npx suparank setup
```

The setup wizard walks you through:
- Creating your Suparank account
- Generating an API key
- Configuring your AI client
- (Optional) Adding WordPress/Ghost credentials

### 2. Configure your project

In the Suparank dashboard, define your:
- Site details (name, URL, niche)
- Brand voice and target audience
- SEO focus keywords
- Visual style preferences

This configuration guides every tool's output.

### 3. Start creating

Open Claude Desktop, Cursor, or your preferred MCP client. Suparank tools appear automatically. For a detailed walkthrough, see our [MCP tools setup guide](/blog/mcp-tools-automated-blog-writing-setup-guide). Start with natural language:

> "I need a blog post about technical SEO for e-commerce sites"

Your AI will orchestrate the full workflow — research, outline, write, optimize, images, publish.
