          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Suparank ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting
            your personal data. This policy explains how we handle your information when you use
            our open-source software and visit our website.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3>Local Data (Not Collected by Us)</h3>
          <p>
            The Suparank skills run entirely on your machine. All data stays local and is never
            sent to our servers. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Third-party credentials (WordPress passwords, CMS API keys)</li>
            <li>Session files and saved content</li>
            <li>Configuration files</li>
            <li>Generated articles and images</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Website Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            When you visit suparank.io, we may collect basic analytics data such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Page views and visit duration</li>
            <li>Referral sources</li>
            <li>Browser type and device information</li>
            <li>Approximate geographic location (country level)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This data is aggregated and anonymized. We do not track individual users across
            sessions or build personal profiles.
          </p>

          <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>The limited information we collect through website analytics is used to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand how visitors use our website</li>
            <li>Improve our documentation and content</li>
            <li>Monitor website performance</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
          <p>
            Suparank is designed with a local-first approach:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>All your content, credentials, and configuration stay on your machine in the ~/.suparank/ directory</li>
            <li>No personal data is sent to or stored on our servers</li>
            <li>Website analytics data is processed by our analytics provider and is not personally identifiable</li>
            <li>Our website is served over HTTPS encryption</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>The Suparank skills may connect to the following third-party services based on your configuration:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>AI Providers:</strong> Content is processed through AI services (Anthropic, OpenAI) based on your AI client</li>
            <li><strong>Publishing Platforms:</strong> WordPress, Ghost, or other CMS platforms you configure</li>
            <li><strong>Image Generation:</strong> Services like fal.ai for generating images</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These connections are initiated locally from your machine using credentials you provide.
            We do not act as an intermediary. Each third-party service has its own privacy policy
            that we recommend reviewing.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Since Suparank stores all data locally on your machine, you have full control over
            data retention. You can delete all Suparank data at any time by removing the
            ~/.suparank/ directory. Website analytics data is retained in aggregated form only.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
          <p>You have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Control:</strong> All your data is stored locally -- you can view, modify, or delete it at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Remove the software and all associated data from your machine</li>
            <li><strong>Opt Out:</strong> Use browser settings or ad blockers to opt out of website analytics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

          <h2>8. Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            Our website may use basic analytics cookies to understand visitor patterns.
            No authentication or tracking cookies are used. You can control cookie
            preferences through your browser settings.

          <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            The Software is not intended for users under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected
