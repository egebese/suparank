## Image 3: MCP vs GPTs Architecture Workflow
**Purpose**: Explain the technical difference between MCP and GPTs
**Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (1920x1080)
**Style**: Technical diagram, workflow visualization

### Detailed Prompt:
```
A split technical architecture diagram comparing MCP (Model Context Protocol) on the left versus GPTs on the right. Left side (MCP): Show Claude Desktop as the central hub, connected to multiple MCP servers (illustrated as modular blocks) labeled "WordPress", "Notion", "GitHub", "Local Files". Each server connects via standardized protocol lines (illustrated as USB-C style connectors with data flowing). Show the MCP architecture as open, modular, with servers running both locally and in the cloud. Include Python/TypeScript code snippets in the background. Right side (GPTs): Show ChatGPT as the central hub, connected to the GPT marketplace (illustrated as an app store style grid of icons) and proprietary Actions (illustrated as locked integrations). Show GPTs as pre-configured assistants in cloud bubbles. Use contrasting visual styles: MCP side looks open and technical with visible connections, GPTs side looks consumer-friendly but closed. Modern technical diagram style with isometric perspective, clean lines, subtle shadows, and professional color scheme (purple for MCP, green for GPTs, gray for shared elements). Include small icons representing portability (arrow between platforms) for MCP and lock icon for GPTs platform lock-in.
```

**Key Elements**:
- Split-screen architecture diagram
- MCP side: modular, open, technical
- GPTs side: consumer-friendly, closed ecosystem
- Connection lines showing data flow
- Visual metaphors (USB-C for MCP, locked icons for GPTs)
- Isometric or technical diagram style
- Clean, professional tech documentation aesthetic

## Implementation Notes

### For Fal.ai / DALL-E Generation:
1. Generate each image at 1920x1080 resolution
2. Use consistent color scheme across all images:
   - Claude: Purple (#C86CC2 to #681C64)
   - ChatGPT: Green (#10B981 to #047857)
   - Neutral: Grays and whites
3. Maintain professional, modern aesthetic throughout
4. Ensure text is readable at article display sizes

### Alternative Approach:
If AI image generation doesn't produce satisfactory results for technical diagrams (Images 2-4), consider:
- Using Figma to create custom diagrams based on these prompts
- Hiring a designer on Fiverr ($10-30 per image)
- Creating simplified versions using Canva templates

### File Naming Convention:
- `claude-vs-chatgpt-hero.png` (Image 1)
